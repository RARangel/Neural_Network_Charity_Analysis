# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

From Alphabet Soup’s business team, a representative received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:
- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

The objective is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- Target variable(s) for the model:
- Feature variable(s) for the model:
- Variable(s) that are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data:

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- Number of neurons:
- Number of layers
- Number of activation functions

- why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
